## PCB

### Software
PCB design can be done in software like EAGLE, Altium, KiCad, or others. We use 
Altium because we had free access to it and knew it had high functionality,
however there are good free alternatives like EAGLE. 

### Design
Our design was heavily based off of the documents prepared by Kevin Tain. The
following images were prepared by Tain. 

Tain's and our approach to the design was modular. We made different schematics
for each system within the larger circuit and then used labelled wires to
connect the schematics where needed. The purpose of splitting the circuit into
smaller circuits was for organization. It is much easier to understand what a
schematic does and to diagnose issues if you have less clutter.
